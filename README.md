# Base-Station 2019

This project is responsible for communicating with the hyperloop pod and sending relevant commands and information back and forth. The web interface is also included in here.

## How to run
This project uses gradle as its build system. The gradle wrapper is already checked into this repo, so no need to explicitly download gradle (unless you want to). Also make sure you install the [protobufs](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) library!! 

#### Build project:
```
$ ./gradlew build
```
(If on windows use `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`)

Also compile protobuf files (can't run backend without generating these files):
```
$ protoc -I=src/main/proto_types/ --java_out=src/main/java/server/ message.proto
```

#### Start up spring server:
```
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

Go to `localhost:8080` and click the 'connect' button to start the websocket connection between the browser and the spring server.

#### Run client side: In another terminal window, run
vvv ***Section below outdated, update*** vvv

```
$ ./build/exe/main/main
```
(there's a `runClient` task in `build.gradle` but for some reason doing this only prints client output once the program ends, which isn't so useful)

#### Start data communication:
Now click 'start pulling data' back on the frontend to start the data communication.

Be sure to make a `/temp` directory in your project's root directory, as this is where the log is stored. Read log with `tail -F temp/server_log.log`
